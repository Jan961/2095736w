    \section{16/12/22}
    I asked about using small dataset sizes to speed up the process of collecting data and running experiments.
    Prof. Chalmers explained that this might not always work because the some characteristics of an algorithm's
    behaviour might change with dataset size but exactly how or when (if at all) this happens for some datasets and
    algorithms requires investigation. I then asked what prof. Chalmers thought about the idea of writing an
    implementation of one of the algorithms myself - just to have something clearly defined to do, even though it would
    seem a bit pointless as there is already a very popular and apparently reliable implementation available on the
    internet. Prof. Chalmers said that writing my own implementation from scratch should not be necessary.
    Finally, we discussed the direction of the work I planned to do over the holiday break. Prof. Chalmers suggested
    I should first focus on conducting some experiments with the algorithms to better understand what might be modified
    to improve them, their sensitivity to changing parameters etc.
