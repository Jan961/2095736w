* Unsolved puzzles in Math,
 What could this be applied to?

* We can evaluate local vs more global structure by comparing with a k-nearest neighbour classifier trained on the embedding  and using cross validation - the measure for comparison can be recall as defined in the k-NN paper
  \
  \
We can make nice swarm plots with accuracy values obtained from cross validation
* We can measure the stability by using something called Procrustes distance (normalised) - between the full embedding and samples - and plot the result against sample size 10% 20% etc
* The guy whose code I will be using for k-KNN came up with UMAP
* Use a 3 dimensional colour cube for testing
